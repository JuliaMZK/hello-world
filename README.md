# hello-world
This is my first try. Nervous and excited. 

Hey guys!

Julia here~

Today is the third day of Lunar New Year. I'm just boring and feel guilty about doing nothing during the whole vacation. Also, I can't stop thinking about the postgraduate entrance exam. Uhhhhh god please just tell me the results and stop torturing me!!!! 

I really want the chance to study in ECNU for another two years and then find a job in Shanghai. I promise I will keep my spirits up and fight for myself in the rest of my lives.

Please!!!!!!
